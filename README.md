# Better Rimworlds Psionic Disruptor

![DeMaterializer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BetterRimworlds/PsionicDisruptor/trunk/PsionicDisruptor/About/Preview.png)

The Psionic Disruptor is a premier defense weapon against all humanoid raiders and other undesirables.

However, if not protected with a some sort of Helmet, your colonists and animals will be affected, too.

**ALERT: The Psionic Disruptor has *harsh* consequences for all higher lifeforms on the map!**

## Exposure Effects ##

* **Psychic Shock:** Everyone without a helmet
* **Coma (12-24h):** 33% chance (75% chance if psychically sensitive).
* **Heart Attack:** 25% chance (50% chance if psychically sensitive; 0% chance if bionic heart).
* **Psychic Hangover:** 50% chance for psychically dull.
* **Psychically Deaf** and those wearing **Psychic Tinfoil Helmet** are 100% immune to the effects.
* **Any helmet** reduces the effects by 25-75%, depending on the class of helmet.
